# Minesweeper

This was written in Fall of 2021, and it creates a game of Minesweeper that can be played in a JFrame. 

As a bonus to this game, I created a secondary window that opens by default. This secondary window changes depending on which square you're hovering over. This was helpful to use when debugging my program, and decided to keep it in as a neat feature.

To disable the secondary window, simply comment out line 61 in Minesweeper.java:
```java
debug.setVisible(true);
```
